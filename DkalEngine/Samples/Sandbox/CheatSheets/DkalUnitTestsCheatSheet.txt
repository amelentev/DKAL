Steps to create & run DkalUnit Tests
======================================

1. Open DkalUnitTests solution in MS Visual Studio 2010 from \DkalEngine\Extensions\DkalHost\Localhost\UnitTests\DkalUnitTests folder

2. Build Solution. Tests could be executed individually or in a group from Test List Editor. Open Test List Editor. Check a set of Tests and click on Execute button. The result of the test would be executed in Test Results window.

3. Every test method has to be annotated with [TestMethod] attribute. Results of a Test Method could be verified through Assert class and respective properties.
4. A new test class could be added by right clicking Project and adding a new Unit Test file. 

5. The Test Methods in Unit Tests could be tested via Test List Editor.

6. Ordered test could also be created by grouping a set of test methods. Running an ordered test would execute the methods in an ascending order of test methods.


7. Tests could also be executed using Test View. It will display all the ordered tests and individual tests.

8. Users could Run tests or debug test methods.

9. All Unit Tests are deployed in an Output deployment directory on every execution.
