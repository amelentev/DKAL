phys1 knows
  SITE tdonS
    PHYS participates in TRIAL at SITE as a physician
    PHYS is allocated patients P1 to P2 in TRIAL at SITE
  keyManager tdonS key for record(N,TRIAL) is K

if Phys1 knows
   asInfon(P1 <= N && N <= P2)
   asInfon(needInfo(N))
then
   say with justification to keyManager
      phys1 requests to read record(N,TRIAL)
   communicate with justification to keyManager
      org(TRIAL) implied phys1 may read record(N,TRIAL)
