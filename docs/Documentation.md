# DKAL Documentation

This section is divided in two parts:
* [Documentation for DKAL users](UserDocumentation). Read this if you want to install DKAL and run policies.
* [Documentation for DKAL developers](DeveloperDocumentation). Read this if you are interested in the engine internals, if you want to extend the engine, rewrite a module or fix a bug.
